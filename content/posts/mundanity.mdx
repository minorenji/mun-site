I have recently been experimenting with writing about situations that are seemingly mundane. Snapshots of life without much embellishment or romanticism.

I've noticed that in mainland Japanese and Okinawan literature, this technique is employed often. "A Conversation" by Yamanokuchi Baku and *Kokoro* by Natsume Souseki in particular strike me as fitting this style.

In western literature, it may be likened to the style of minimalist writing, characteristic of Hemingway, for example.

In any case, this style of almost dry prose is fascinating, and sometimes powerfully moving despite the lack of 'colorful' language. 'Still life' writing has the ability to deliver deeper emotions and thought in a style that is unpretentious, uncomplicated, and easy to relate to. It is, at its core, a very honest form of writing.
