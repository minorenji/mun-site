Sometimes when you are walking late in the streets you can see buses stopped on the side of the road with "TO TERMINAL" flashing as the destination. The inside is lit up by the cool white light as the driver inspects the seats.

It's like the very picture of death. The horse that death usually rides on except a bus. Or maybe the bus driver is the horse in this analogy. Who knows.

Terminal. It means an end, but also a new beginning. It's where the bus returns, and also departs. It's where no one ever rides the bus to get to. It is the great beyond. It is what lies beyond the veil. It is hell and heaven in one.

A fascinating and terrifying place. Terminal.

Which reminds me that the math midterm is coming up again.


## Rashomon
I read *Rashomon and Other Stories* by Akutagawa and "Rashomon" is really not what I expected. I don't really know what I was expecting but part of it was that I expected it to be longer than a dozen pages. But perhaps there is a reason why it is Akutagawa's most famous work.

I haven't thought about it enough to properly analyze anything. But let's just say I think of it when I go to the Ave at night.

## Tarot
I got back into tarot cards. I think it can potentially be a useful tool but I'm not sure if it's helped me yet.

Can cards tell the future? Yes, but you don't *need* cards to tell the future. We do it all the time anyway.

My favorite of the Major Arcana is The Fool right now. I hope to become more fool-ish.

## Condon Hall
Condon Hall. It's Condone without an 'e' (or condom with an 'n' instead of the 'm', if you prefer).

I took my math midterm there. I lost an earbud there. Then, I went back and found my earbud.

An epic story of loss and redemption. With a math test thrown in there.

I'm going back in a week. A pilgrimage, if you will.

## Higonokami
Sometimes, fate works in interesting ways. It seems as though something is not destined to happen, but unexpectedly, it does anyway.

On the other hand, what we most desire may never occur. But as "Yam Gruel" taught us, desire is sometimes sweeter than the actual thing itself.

## Vision
When you are shuffling cards, its customary to shuffle them face down. Because if they're face up when you shuffle you are becoming a witness to a process that is supposed to be secret. It's like a violation of something sacred. If you can see it it's like it's no longer truly random.

Same thing when you drop a card when shuffling. That shuffle no longer counts.

Theoretically, is there not an equal probability of getting dealt a hand that contains many of the same suit or color as there is of getting a hand that's more evenly distributed? And yet when people get a hand that's all of one color they complain that it hasn't been shuffled right.

I think about that sometimes.

## Cold Shower
Winter is approaching so the weather is colder now. It is a good time to take cold showers. What's the point of the cold shower? It's been proven to have some health benefits.

Why do I really do it? Because it feels good.
