i think that after about  
3 days in the fridge,  
a salad starts to go bad.  

ideally, it should be eaten before then.  

but at the same time,  
i don't often feel  
the urge to eat that  
refridgerated salad.  
so the act of eating itself  
becomes a chore than i must  
complete before the due date.  

just another deadline  
in a sea of others that  
i'm trying not to drown in.
