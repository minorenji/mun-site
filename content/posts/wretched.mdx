we all come into this world wretched, and spend the rest of our lives trying to escape that wretchedness.

it is probably true that each of us has the latent ability to redeem ourselves already within us, and yet we are unable to do so.

*the greatest gift that can be given to another is the gift of understanding.*

**function 1:**  
let the water go.  
it cannot be grasped  
between your fingertips.  
it is destined to flow  
ever downwards,  
back to the earth  
from which it came.

**function 2:**  
sing a song for every animal  
that saw you and died.  
if you were afraid,  
that fear was only  
magnitudes greater  
for that creature.

**function 3:**  
stop blocking out the light.  
it may blind and burn you but  
that is just a part of  
being purified.

**function 4:**  
take your time with everything.  
life is not something  
that you should rush to finish.  
unless of course,  
you want to be done.

**function 5:**  
run.  
whatever is chasing you  
will not waste a moment.  
but it is only as fast  
as you are.  

**function 6:**  
look at their eyes.  
they're looking into yours.  
what do you see?  
that's right,  
yourself, reflected in the other.

**function 7:**  
luck is not a finite resource.  
so feel free to be as lucky as you want.  
only a fool refuses to use their luck.

**function 8:**  
misfortune is as inevitable  
as injury and death.  
embrace it.  
it only exists as much as  
you allow yourself to miss.

**function 9:**  
cry until you can't anymore,  
then laugh until you have to catch  
your breath, then sleep until  
you have to wake, and at last    
see the world with clarity.

**function 10:**  
calculate the trajectory  
of this sentence;  
no cheating!  
there are only ten  
marbles in this bag because  
one melted away and  
the other was swallowed  
by The Albatross.

**function 11:**  
there is only so much  
you can pretend to know  
before it becomes clear  
that you know just as much  
about nothing as nobody  
never knew.

**function 12:**  
the black keys  
on the piano  
are meant to be  
pressed only  
in case of emergencies.  
don't break the glass,  
but do play  
Ã‰tude Op. 10, No. 5  
by Chopin.
