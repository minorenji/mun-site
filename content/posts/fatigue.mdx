## stormwater pond

it rained again today,  
but it seemed the wetness would not  
remain for long.

it rained again today,  
but i did not smell the rain.  

it rained again today,  
i think it did,  
but now i do not know if

it rained again today.

## mistkae

that which is spoken,  
can never be inhaled back  
to where it once came.

we can only try to cover it up  
with more words, more noise,  
only making more mistakes to hide the first.

## no need

sand castles don't need sand people to live in them.  
there's no one to complain when the tide comes  
and claims their homes.  

i don't need to defend myself because there's no one here anyways.

## fatigue

i think it's too early to be tired.  
too early when the sun's still out and the people are still  
talking loudly outside.

too early when i still have stuff i haven't finished and people i haven't met.  

too early to be tired. but i am tired.

## tzx

tzx. again. i wonder why.  
i really do wonder. why sometimes  
but i can't complain because i'm a good person  
right?

## carp's end

i imagined a fish in the ocean.  
it was in my imagination but  
probably it actually existed  
because there are a lot of fish.

i imagined a fish in the ocean but it died.  
i hope it's doing okay.

## i don't write for you
