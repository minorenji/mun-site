sleep is the brother of death. no, literally.


death is really not so bad if you think about it as going to sleep. forever.

but that's not what i wanted to write about.

it's easy to view life as a series of ups and downs, where you have a phase where you feel like your life is "good", eventually followed by a "bad" phase, and so on.

but what really makes you decide whether you're content with life at any given moment?

the average day in anyone's life is not very exciting. in fact, it's filled with quite mundane stuff. and this is regardless of who you are, how much money you have, what position you occupy, etc. because once something becomes a daily responsibility, no matter how exciting it was initially, will inevitably become boring.

so how do you stay happy?

that's what we are all wondering.

but in reality, it's probably pretty simple. it's very simple. but the problem is actually understanding and *living* that truth. just hearing it isn't enough. anyone could tell you. you could hear it a thousand times and still be unhappy. because you don't understand what it means.

...

and i planned to write about something more positive. something happy. let's try again.
