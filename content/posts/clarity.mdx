## refinement

inkstone. ground  
and ground again  
until it releases  
that essence of  
of the literary  
imagination.

that is what i am doing now to my brain.  
grinding it from something coarse to something  
finer, until at last relevations come spewing  
forth and all is clear.  

or so i hope. but this is a rather optimistic  
prediction.

i know i have the ability to see, but am struggling to open my eyes.

## i think too much
think.  
think back to that time  
when the fog was lifted  
and visibility stretched  
for miles.

i tried to remember but the grey mist had thickened to the point where i could not see even 5 feet ahead. the light i held in my hand could not penetrate this barrier either. so i had no choice but to advance, into the unknown.

## still life
i ordered my drink   
and sat down to wait.
many people came and went,  
some of them ordering drinks  
as well,  
and others just walking past.  

i scrolled through my phone  
even though there was nothing  
i wanted to see in particular.  
it just felt like the natural thing to do  
in this public setting.  

after a couple minutes of this,  
they called my name  
so i got up to get my latte.  
it was a bit hot which was  
a problem not because it was  
too hot to drink,  
but because i was wearing many  
layers and would probably feel  
hot in the classroom.  

a couple minutes of discomfort  
is nothing compared to my  
entire lifetime, i thought.  
to be able to drink  
this coffee, i am blessed.

in any case,  
i took my drink  
and left.
