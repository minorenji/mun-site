i sat at the seat beside  
the window and it occurred  
to me that people from the  
outside might see me but  
who even looks into the window  
before walking inside anyways.

i had nothing but a can of  
monster and a notebook  
(and my phone)  
and i was trying to get  
my mind racing  
so i could write some cool things  
in that journal.

it didn't quite give me the kick  
i was looking for but maybe two cans  
would have done the trick.

*make sure to drink two cans before any college-level exam.*

i was biding my time trying to stave  
off anxiety and existential dread  
but maybe i needed a depressant for that  
and not a stimulant. oh well.

when i write in first-person  
am i writing as 'myself'  
or am i playing a character?

the answer is, i am in fact  
playing a character but i *am*  
that character.

but what i am trying to do when  
i write is to be honest.  
it is only through writing i can be  
completely honest because it is a  
meta-commentary on the life i am  
acting out.

when i write in first-person,  
i am most definitely writing  
from my perspective.
