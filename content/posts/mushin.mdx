It was a little past two o'clock when I was having lunch in the cafeteria. It was a bit late for lunch, but I had also eaten breakfast late due to starting the day late. There was not that many people at this time, so apart from the ambient noise from the kitchen, it was mostly quiet and unremarkable.

This was the kind of atmosphere I enjoyed, the kind that is not completely silent and devoid of activity, but an environment that was peaceful yet showed signs of life. I was quite relaxed, not too worried about the upcoming exams, the start of the next quarter, nor my plans for the rest of the day. I had resolved to simply enjoy this moment where I had nothing particular to do. It was in this kind of mood and setting that I first saw him.

He was the only other person sitting in this section of the dining hall, gazing at an open laptop. I imagined that he was studying for exams, or doing schoolwork of some sort. Even though we did not make eye contact, nor spoke a single word to each other, I felt a sort of companionship from his presence. Others occasionally passed through the area, but he was the only one that stayed.

After I finished my latte, I wrote a couple closing remarks then packed my things to leave. I noticed that he had also gotten up and began to zip up his backpack. We approached the exit at about the same time, myself ahead of him. I opened the door and held it for him.

"Thanks," he said simply. I nodded and began walking to class. He left in the opposite direction.

That was the first interaction I had with him, when I did not yet know his name or anything about him other than the sound of his voice, the color of his eyes and hair, and the way he carried himself. And yet, I felt that he was a very pleasant person to be around.

The next day, I returned to the cafeteria at about the same time. I had eaten lunch earlier with a friend so I was just stopping by to get some coffee. On my way out, I glanced towards the area I had been sitting at the day before and found that once again, he was there with his open laptop. I had planned to take my coffee and leave but seeing him there, I decided to stay.

You might be wondering what fashion I was drawn to him. My answer is quite simple: I felt at ease when he was near. It was nothing like any romantic or platonic feelings I had experienced before. He had the air of a mentor even though he had not taught me a single thing. Yet I had no strong desire to go over and talk to him, to get to know him. I was content with just his presence. I did not even desire to be acknowledged by him. I thought that if he noticed me and remembered me, that would be nice, but it did not matter whether he did.

I never saw him again after that day, even when I went to the same place at the same time. But I have not made any effort to find him nor figure out who he was.

I just thought, that it is rather remarkable that a stranger left such a strong impression on me that I am writing about it now.
