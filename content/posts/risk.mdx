'no risk no reward' is the age old maxim. does it hold true? maybe in the stock market but in many cases, it is possible to mitigate a lot of risk and accumulate rewards. still, it is true that to win big in a single sweep some risk is likely involved.

perhaps it is risky to write about personal content on a public site. the risk may be less in the exposure of personal info but more in the fact that in my writing, my feelings are exposed transparently. i doubt that many people are reading this, however.

everyone is attracted to different things, mostly. of course, there are some universally attractive traits but there are some components of romance that draw some people and do not others... often it is the risk, the idea of loss that creates a greater thrill.

i have not felt that thrill in a long time... perhaps never. but how important is it to live chasing a feeling? it could mean everything, or nothing, depending on how you view it... but when life gets slow and more time is spent in your mind... one begins to wonder if someone exciting might be out there.
