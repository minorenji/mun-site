as i trudged through the grimy water, i tried not to look down. the sight of cigarette butts, dented cans, and plastic bags all stirring in a murky soup was enough to make me naseous. it was a good thing that i'd traded my umbrella for a pair of boots. at least the rain was clean. mostly.

from where i was it seemed like i was the only one awake in the city. not that i could see very far with the fog that had descended overnight. but i couldn't hear any shouting either. perhaps the usual drunks had already passed out. surveying my surroundings, i spotted something somewhat unusual. it was a plastic bottle. what had once been regarded as common trash had now become a valuable resource, because those bottles were buoyant and could be used to make rafts. so far, i had only managed to collect 23 of them. i suspected i'd need at least 45, maybe less if i stumbled upon a saw. then at least i could try to make some planks out of the drifting logs.

the bottle was drifting away, carried by a slight current. there must have been a drain somewhere in the distance that was somehow still working. not that it would be for long. i picked up my pace to catch up to it, only to realize that there was something inside. it looked like a rolled up piece of paper, almost like a message in a bottle. i supposed there was no need to go to the beach send that kind of message anymore, when everywhere was connected to the sea now. i shook it out into my hands, and unfolded it.

it read:  
> dear wanderer: did you enjoy my gift? while it would be nice to have your own raft, what if we pooled our resources to make a ship? perhaps we could row inland to the cascades before this whole area goes under. the crew of the Carp's Mouth is already 15 strong, and currently stationed at Bellevue. we hope to see you soon. yours truly, M. Hu.

certainly, it was an interesting proposition. it was also true that even if i managed to make a small raft, it was unlikely i'd make it to the highlands before the water level rose too high. and introducing yourself with a gift was always a nice way make new friends. i just needed to make it to Bellevue.

if i recalled correctely, the boatman had told me that the fare was just $25. evidently, the cost of services had dropped quite a bit, although this was offset by the deflation. but still, from Seattle to Bellevue for only $25, seemed like a good deal. so i turned around, and started trekking to the makeshift pier.
