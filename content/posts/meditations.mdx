I am, therefore I think. Such is the zen inversion of Descartes' famous axiom.


> A rose is not a rose. That is why it is truly a rose.

I am emptiness, and that is why I exist.

words, speech, all forms  
soil that which  
is the only honored  
and sacred one across the  
Six Realms.

天上天下唯我独尊。

the great  
gateless gate  
begins at once to creak open  
and rays of infinite light  
shine through the opening  
illuminate my face,  
my true  
face.  

the One cannot observe the One.  

>하나는 하나를 볼 수 없다.
