this i must confess, 

that  
despite the errant  
nature of my ramblings  
i am not trying to break out  
of the mold  
instead i am like a person  
on the beach drawn in the sand  
bending my arms and legs  
back and forth with the wind  
and at the mercy of the tide,  

i am not thinking or speaking  
or moving or breathing,  
i am but the empty pot after  
all the water has boiled away  
i am but the empty canvas  
upon which all thoughts and matter  
dance like puppets before their strings  
are cut loose and  
i am but the blueness of the sky  
which is not actually blue at all  
but is only blue because it reflects the ocean,  

i am the wave racing towards a distant shore,  

i am the wave in the pacific  
dreaming of land but not realizing  
that i am not separate from the ocean  
which has already crashed against the  
the cliff overlooking the sea  
millions of times forevermore  
since before beforeness.

this i must confess.
