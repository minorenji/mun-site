scenes from my childhood.

---

## just playing outside

climbing up the familiar hill,  
the sky just lightly  
dyed from sun's red smear,  
as evening breeze carries to my ears  
sounds of children's  
laughter in the distance.  

i wonder what food awaits at home.


## sisyphus

palms, coated in sweat  
and fingers slipping off  
the keys.  
heart, wrenched tight from  
dread,  
from the weight of my parents,  
no,  
my *own* dreams.  

rinsing my hands free of  
the milk of latent terror,  
i glance in the mirror.

a boy's face, twisted  
from fatigue and helplessness.

## staircase

I  
up,  
sun,  
light,    
window,  
laziness.
