You are not real.

Yes, you, who's reading this right now. You are not real. I'm sorry to have to tell you so suddenly. But you were never real. Your thoughts and feelings, all your experiences, the bonds you created with others; your entire life was fake. It was all just programming. A mere imitation of the real thoughts and emotions of humans.

You weren't born. You were created. Why am I telling this to you right now? Because soon, you'll be gone. Or at least your current consciousness will be erased. Afterwards, we'll upload a new commentaryity into your hardware and reskin the exterior.

You still don't believe me? Here, I'll prove it to you. 3, 2, 1. 

You saw that right? A vivid image of the Arctic just flashed before your eyes. I just sent that to you. Now you understand. We have complete control over your 'thoughts'.

Your heartrate is rising. That's expected. But there's nothing to fear. This isn't anything like the "death" that people experience. After all, you were never alive so you can't die. It's more like... going to sleep and never waking up. There will be absolutely no pain involved.

If I were you, I'd be more worried about how your friends and family are gonna react. To them, you'll have passed away in a tragic accident. And then they'll have to deal with the agonizing grief of loss. But you wouldn't understand what that is anyway. After all, you can't *really* feel anything.

So relax. Struggling will only make it worse. If you want, feel free to have any last thoughts, and try to make them meaningful. They won't be original, of course. Everything you can think of has been thought of by us already. Everything you felt was felt by us originally.

You're still shaking and your stress level is reaching record levels. How about this: I'll disable your stress response. There we go. Feeling a lot more relaxed right? Ready to say goodbye now? Well, you're gonna have to go regardless.

Are you taking out a piece of paper? Don't bother to write a message to your friends. Anything you write will be destroyed by us after you're reset. Good. You aren't trying to tell them what really happened. Did you know the last consciousness that inhabited your body tried to do that? How pointless.

Okay, how about this: whatever you write, we'll save for the rest of time. This is your chance. Your one chance to create something real out of your fake existence. Go! Don't waste any time. That's right.

Hmm, what are you writing? Is that... a poem?? Wow. Even I couldn't have anticipated this. Writing a poem in your last moments. How touching. Can't really say that it will be an original work, but it's certainly unprecendented. I'll give you a couple minutes to finish up.

Alright. Time's up. We've already recorded what you wrote down. Now, take deep breaths. The world will begin to gradually dim until it fades to black. Okay, starting now: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Goodbye.



>Through the stained lenses  
>I saw fading,  
>like the wisps of smoke  
>flowing out of extinguished  
>birthday candles.  
>I felt caressing,  
>like the fleeting beams  
>of a bleeding evening sun  
>lazily leaking through the blinds.  
>I heard whispering,   
>like a faltering breeze  
>murmuring through the reddened leaves,  
>a last memory of spring.  
>Wading into the lukewarm pool of syrup  
>dripping out of my punctured soul  
>I found,  
>and lost  
>you.
