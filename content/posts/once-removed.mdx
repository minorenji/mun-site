preface:

why do i no longer write pure commentary which can be understood in convential non-figurative terms?

because i have realized the failure of words to illustrate what i really want to say.  

if i write in a way that makes sense, the reader will naturally try to comprehend the meaning of the words. but the words are just an expedient, just the finger pointing at the moon. attachment to the words will prevent ever seeing the moon.

all words are once removed from their true meaning.
