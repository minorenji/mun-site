you,  
me,  
everyone,  
we are all the product  
of the artistry of the  
stars and planets painted  
on the canvas that is our  
ever-expanding universe.

when we gaze into the sky,  
when we gaze into the eyes of another,  
when we close our eyes and gaze inwards,  
we discover time and time again that  
we are made of the stuff of stars.  

who cares about loneliness, love,  
pride, ambition, good, evil,  
light, dark, and all those things  
we made up because we were afraid?

we are all already part of a celestial masterpiece.
