somewhere,  
on the other side of the world  
somebody must have tossed  
a stone into a pond  
a bit too far  
because for the last couple days  
i have felt increasingly  
off-kilter.

the wind must have blown  
at just the right angle  
for that stone to sink  
into deeper waters  
than it would have.

then the turtle, dwelling  
at the bottom of the pond  
while chasing after a tadpole  
must have nudged the stone  
a little to the left  
letting it reach depths  
it never should have reached.

so now,  
i find myself,  
listless,  
sitting at this desk  
in a dimly lit room  
as the sun sets outside  
writing  
about this
seasonal affliction.

i'm waiting for spring  
when  
the icy sheet covering  
the pond will thaw,  
and a child,  
fascinated by the glint of  
something in the water  
will reach in and retrieve  
that smooth, polished stone  
that was weighing me down  
all through the winter.
