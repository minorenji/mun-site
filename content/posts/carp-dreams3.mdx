## stream

returning home,  
i crossed the same bridge  
that i always take.

yet today,  
i did not see  
the mountain hare drinking from the stream,  
the sky tinged in shades of purple,   
nor the leaves that were shedding their green,  
dressed in red and orange.

i did not hear  
the murmur of the cicadas ringing in my ears,  
the sparrows gossiping from their perches,  
nor the gentle whisper of the creek,  
that would continue for eternity.

all i could see  
was her smile,  
and all i could hear,  
was her sweet goodbye.
