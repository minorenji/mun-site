## the masterpiece

The painter drapes the leaves with fire in autumn,  
and come spring soaks the blossoms in blood.  
He separates the smooth and scalding,  
the crisp and piercing.  
He distinguishes that which stings the tongue  
from the softly stroking flavors.  
Scattering all these across the canvas   
so that they may lie silently.  
He parts his lips but makes no sound.  
The painting speaks through the vibrations.  
Oscillating the soul and spirit, it creates noise.

## shoebox

By day, piercing the darkness  
a lone shaft of copper and bronze.  
It is bitter, sour, forcing us to  
cover our flesh  
cowling in the corner.  
Yet, as if awakened by the glare   
the flecks of dust begin to dance,  
prancing around the light.  
Eventually, the festivities die  
and the silence holds us hostage once more  
until the night arrives,  
and with it, a dash of quicksilver  
leaking into view.  
It caresses the skin, like a cold spoon  
pressed against the cheek.  
We remove the cloth which had bound us,  
so that the pale beams  
may raise every hair of the body.  
And then  
we begin to dance.

## casted away

Through the stained lenses  
I saw fading,   
like the wisps of smoke  
flowing out of extinguished  
birthday candles.  
I felt caressing,   
like the fleeting beams  
of a bleeding evening sun  
lazily leaking through the blinds.  
I heard whispering,   
like a faltering breeze   
murmuring through the reddened leaves,  
a last memory of spring.  
Wading into the lukewarm pool of syrup  
dripping out of my punctured soul  
I found,  
and lost  
you.
