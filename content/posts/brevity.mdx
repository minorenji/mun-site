i imagine that  
somewhere out there,  
there must be at least one person,  
who,  
due to their extreme lightness  
and complete lack of opacity,  
just floated away and vanished.  
forgotten by no one, because  
no one remembered them in the first place.

i remember days gone by just  
sitting at the window  
watching,  
the water dripping from icicles,  
the raindrops rolling down the glass,  
the petals riding the breeze,  
the leaves drifting back to earth,  
the snow descending from the sky.  
until one day i got up,  
turned around,  
and found myself all alone.

it's fun to laugh until  
you have to catch yourself,  
take a deep breath,  
clear your mind,  
and suddenly,  
that humorous spark has all but vanished,  
and you are left again with that  
mild sense of fatigue  
and boredom.

it is a shame,  
a shame that for every minute of inspiration,  
you must endure hours of disillusionment.
