## ave things

a shout,  
from down the street.  

the sound of some  
unknown music that comes  
and goes by.  

the need to avert the gaze,  
or to meet it and face yourself.  

a shout,  
from closer now.  

the scent that you can feel.  

the aimlessness of everything.  

the last step before the shout  

the shout is here.

i am shouting. i am the one shouting.  

and all the eyes around me are mine.

## yeah

something is wrong.  
something feels like  
it doesn't match.  
that something  
is just trying to  
get away  
to be by itself  
to look up and hope to see  
nothing but the clouds and no sky.  

but that something is already alone.  
that something is asking  
the wrong questions.  

i think this is when i should say  

yeah.

## #fffff
