all of human history has led up to this point.

the trajectory of every particle since before time has created a chain of events that brought you here. 

there is nothing that has ever happened that would have led any part of the universe to prevent this moment.

but, somehow,   
you, in your hubris,  
have decided that this, which has already happened,  
is a "bad" thing that never should have happened to you?

no wonder the gods have left us.
