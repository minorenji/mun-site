> today, i killed today again.

i dreamt a dream and in that dream  
a lot of people appeared many of  
them familiar faces  
and others without faces  
and i when i woke up i killed  
them all.

i killed the dream  
and got up and killed my sleeping self  
and drank water and killed my  
thirsting self  
and washed my face  
and killed my unwashed self  
and put on glasses and in an instant i  
killed that blurry world and replaced  
it with a clear one.

and now gazing into this  
indigo void i prepare to kill  
the person who wrote this.
