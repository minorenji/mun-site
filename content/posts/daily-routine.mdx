first, a sense of urgency.  
it gets me to wake up only once, not twice.  

next, a sense of imperfection.  
consumes time but may not be necessary.

finally, a sense of complacency.  
it seems as though there is plenty of time.

and so it repeats.

i wonder,  
what would it take  
to purge all sense of time?
