**E:** so, you're not interested in any of that?  
**I:** no. I just want to feel *everything*.  
**E:** I see.

the streetlights  
sped past  
their glow multiplied  
in the marbled droplets  
coating the glass.

ephemeral incandescence  
dancing on the windshield.  

the sight seemed to pull  
from the depths of my memory  
the vast collection of lights  
burned into my eyes  
from days past.

it was slightly sad to think  
that this moment as well  
would become a dream  
in the days to come.

**I:** so you just write stuff with arbitrary line breaks and call it poetry?  
**E:** yes.
