my old kendo sensei was someone  
who struck me as being deeply  
rooted in tradition.  
he was strict but it was that  
strict treatment that first  
taught me something about discipline.  

and yet, I couldn't endure it so  
I quit the dojo.  
I was afraid,  
afraid of being called out,  
criticized in front of others.  

he was not the type to go easy on you  
because you were new,  
nor the type to offer  
words of encouragement,  
if you were working hard.  
but he sure as hell would point out  
your lack of *kiai*,  
flaws in your form,  
or anything which he saw as the  
wrong attitude.


he always said,  
*en wo kiru na!*  
meaning, don't  
end the relationship,  
don't  
cut the invisible  
thread that connects  
you and your opponent.

as soon as you look away from their  
eyes or let your focus on them falter,  
that thread has been cut, and at that moment  
you have already lost.

there is a thread that connects us  
to everyone else in the world.  
we can increase,  
or decrease the length of that thread,  
manipulating the distance as we wish.  

but to cut the thread is something we cannot do,  
because in this world  
of 7 billion people,  
we are all entangled by that  
red, invisible, yet indestructible  
thread of fate.


I can still hear quite vividly in my mind  
his voice,  
shouting,  
### **縁を切るな！**
